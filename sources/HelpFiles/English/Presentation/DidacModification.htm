<h2>Manual modifications</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="images/DidacM1.gif" width="441" height="269"></p>
<p>The previously identified curve may not be perfect, due to some annotations 
  on the graphic for instance. In order to remove these imperfections, you can 
  directly modify the curve on the graphic by drawing on it.</p>
<p>Two different tools are available for the modifications : a pen <img border="0" src="images/Pen.gif" width="22" height="22"> 
  and a rubber <img border="0" src="images/Rubber.gif" width="22" height="22">.</p>
<p>When the pen is used, the points located vertically to the pen are replaced 
  with the drawn ones.</p>
<p>When the rubber is used, the points which have the same abscissa value than 
  the cursor are erased.</p>
<h3>Undo / Redo</h3>
<p>You can undo or redo every modification operation by using the buttons <img border="0" src="images/Undo.gif" width="48" height="23"> 
  (undo) and <img border="0" src="images/Redo.gif" width="48" height="23"> (redo). 
  The number of operation kept in memory is only limited by the total amount of 
  available memory. However, the modification history is lost when this dialog 
  box is closed (by using the &quot;Previous&quot; button for instance).</p>
<h3>Reset</h3>
<p>All the modifications are canceled and the curve is rebuilt from the data previously 
  defined. This operation can also be canceled by the &quot;Undo&quot; button 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this step, the curve identification is finished. CurveUnscan will then 
  ask you for exporting the results immediately or later (if the recognition of 
  an other curve has to be done).</p>
<p>You can save the results at any time (when an identification sequence is not 
  currently running), using the <img border="0" src="images/SaveData.gif" width="23" height="21"> 
  button or the File / Data export menu.</p>
