<h2>Choice of the kind of curve</h2>
<p>Once the coordinates system is defined, you have to choose the mode of the 
  curve analysis.</p>
<p>CurveUnscan performs recognition using four different modes: continuous curves, 
  spline curves, discrete curves (scattered points), and densitometry curves.</p>
<p>The continuous curves are recognized from different element chosen by the user 
  : definition range, location on the graphic, line thickness, ...</p>
<p>The spline mode allows to analyse the graphic using spline curves. These mathematical 
  curves are build as in drawing tool, from &quot;anchor points&quot; chosen by 
  the user.</p>
<p>The discrete curves, or scattered points, are made of a set of unrelated points. 
  These points are individually identified by the user. </p>
<p>The densitometry curve consist to the analysis of a color profile, on a segment 
  of the graphic.</p>
