<h2 >Densitometry curve</h2>
<p >This kind of curve is used to analyse a color profile on the graphic. A value 
  is associated to each pixel of a segment (user-defined) on the graphic. This 
  value is calculated according to the pixel color and a color scale (right part 
  of the dialogbox)</p>
<p ><img src="/Presentation/images/DidacDensito.gif" width="441" height="269"></p>
<h3>Draw segment</h3>
<p>When the segment to analyze has not already been drawn, the &quot;Draw segment&quot; 
  button is pressed. So draw a segment on the part of the graphic you want to 
  analyze. If this segment is larger than the window, the graphic scrolls automatically. 
  When the &quot;Shift&quot; key is pressed, the line is drawn parallel to the 
  border of the window. </p>
<h3>Preview</h3>
<p>When the segment has been defined, the &quot;Preview&quot; button can be used 
  to show the color profile on this segment. The direction of this profiles goes 
  from the beginning of the segment (left side of the preview window) to its end. 
  However, this representation direction is only used for the preview and can 
  be modified during the exported data format definition (see <a href="/Presentation/DidacEnregistrement.htm">Results 
  formating </a>)</p>
<h3>Color scale</h3>
<p>This part of the dialog box is used to define the value associated to each 
  color of the graphic. A value is associated to each of the two colors of the 
  scale. During the curve identification, the values of the encountered intermediate 
  colors are calculated linearly by projection (in the color mathematical space) 
  on the axis that links these two colors.</p>
<p>In other words, if one of the colors is black and the other is white, the calculated 
  values for the encountered colors are related to their brightness.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td width="10%">Color 1</td>
    <td width="9%">Value 1</td>
    <td width="16%">Color 2</td>
    <td width="8%">Value 2</td>
    <td width="15%">Pixel</td>
    <td width="42%">Related value</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td width="10%">(255,255,255) white</td>
    <td width="9%">0</td>
    <td width="16%">(0,0,0) black</td>
    <td width="8%">100</td>
    <td width="15%">(127,127,127) gray</td>
    <td width="42%">50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr align="center"> 
    <td width="10%">(0,0,0) black</td>
    <td width="9%">0</td>
    <td width="16%">(255,0,0) red</td>
    <td width="8%">100</td>
    <td width="15%">(0,255,0) green</td>
    <td width="42%"> 
      <p>0 </p>
      <p>(there is no green component in the red)</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To modify the scale colors, you can either click on the colored button (a dialog 
  bow appears, allowing to adjust each of the color component), or use the <img src="/Presentation/images/Dropper.gif" width="27" height="24"> 
  buttons to directly choose the color on the graphic.</p>
<p>The &quot;Use as default&quot; button is used to save the color scale (colors 
  and related values) in order to use the same color scale with different densitometry 
  curves. </p>
