<h2>Data formatting</h2>
<p>Before saving the results into a file, you have to define the format of the 
  data previously identified.</p>
<p>When you ask CurveUnscan to export the data, a dialog box is opened, which 
  allow you to format the data. The name of the recognized curves are initially 
  displayed in the left list of the dialog box. In order to have these curves 
  in the output file, you only have to put them into the right list, using the 
  related arrow. The two buttons located to the right of the dialog box can be 
  used for modifying the order of the curves in the output file. The &quot;Preview&quot; 
  button displays the final results on the screen. By clicking on the &quot;Format&quot; 
  button, you can choose the character which will be used in the output file as 
  a column separator.</p>

<p>When a continuous curve, a spline curve or a densitometry curve goes from the 
  left list to the right one, an other dialog box is displayed. This dialog box 
  allows to define the number of points that will be saved in the output file.</p>
<h3>Continuous curve :</h3>

<h3>Spline curve:</h3>

<h3>Densitometry curve :</h3>
<p>For the densitometry curves, either the X value of the calculated points, or 
  Y value, or both, can be written. When the analyzed segment is parallel to the 
  abscissa axis, only abscissa value can be displayed. The same when the segment 
  is parallel to the ordinates axis (the other coordinate is constant).</p>

<p>Initially, the first saved point is the one of the segment which has the lowest 
  abscissa value. This point must belong to the drawn segment. Its minimum and 
  maximum coordinates values are displayed in the dialog box. The X and Y are 
  linked one to the other because this point must be on the segment : modifying 
  the abscissa value leads to modify the ordinate value too, and conversely.</p>
<p>You can express the frequency of saving either through the abscissa frequency 
  or ordinates frequency. A negative value is allowed. As for the first saved 
  point, the abscissa and the ordinates frequency are linked together. Modifying 
  the X values leads to modify the Y one. When a scale is logarithmic, the period 
  related to this axis is expressed in decade of unit.</p>

<p>The as generated data are written in a file readable by MS-Exel or any other 
  spreadsheet or data processing software.</p>
