<h1>Coordinates system</h1>
<p>The coordinates systems handled by CurveUnscan consist of two axes. Each one 
  has to be defined only by a segment and two scale points. A scale point consists 
  of a point on the axis and a value. The scale can be linear or logarithmic.</p>
<p>No assumption is made by CurveUnscan on the axes direction (parallel to the 
  window border or not), their orthogonality, nor the value direction (for the 
  X axis for instance, the values can be increasing or decreasing from left to 
  right). The only validity condition is that the two axes cannot be parallel. 
  Furthermore, when an axis is logarithmic, its scale values must be strictly 
  greater than 0.</p>

<p>These construction facilities allow to handle non-orthogonal coordinates system 
  and can correct the angular error that could have been induced by the scanning 
  step.</p>
