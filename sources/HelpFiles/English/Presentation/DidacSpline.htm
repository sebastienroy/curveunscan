<h2>Spline curve</h2>
<p>The spline curves allows to digitize graphics very easily, by drawing on the 
  original curves, as in a drawing tool. The spline curves are drawn from the 
  anchor points choosen by the user. The anchor points are either fixed points 
  or slope points.</p>

<p>The creation and the modification of the spline curves are made through 5 different 
  tools (buttons from left to right) :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adding points at the end of the curve (default selected tool)</li>
  <li>Adding points at the beginning of the curve</li>
  <li>Adding points in the middle of the curve</li>
  <li>Points removal</li>
  <li>Points modifications</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adding points at the end of the curve</h3>
<p>With this tool, the fixed points are created at the place where the left mouse 
  button is pressed. The assocaited slope points are created where the mouse button 
  is released. When the slope point is dragged, another slope point is drawn on 
  the other side of the fixed point, symmetrically. If the Ctrl key is pressed, 
  the two slope points are unbinded. This behaviour can be used to make sharp 
  corners. The Shift key can be used to re-bind them, and then, smooth the corners. 
  Each new point is created at the end of the cure.</p>
<h3>Adding points at the beginning of the curve</h3>
<p>This tool is similar to the previous one. The new points are created at the 
  other end of the curve.</p>
<h3>Adding points in the middle of the curve</h3>
<p>With this tool, it is possible to add points in the middle of allready build 
  curves. The slope points are adjusted in order to have exactely the same curve 
  path with the new point. Once a new point has been added, the &quot;Points modification&quot; 
  tool is automatically activated.</p>
<h3>Points removal</h3>
<p>With this tool, the user can remove points created previously.</p>
<h3>Points modifications</h3>
<p>This tool allows to modify (position or slope) the points of a spline curve.</p>
