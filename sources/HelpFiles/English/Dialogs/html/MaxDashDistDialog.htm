<h2>Maximal distance between dashes</h2>
<p>Enter the maximal distance (in pixels) between two dashes. The curve is recalculated, 
  taking into account the new value each time you click on the &quot;Apply&quot; 
  button or &quot;Ok&quot; button.</p>
<p>A too small value stops the curve following if the distance between two dashes 
  is greater than this value.</p>
<p>However, a too high value can lead to some inconsistencies in the curve following.</p>
