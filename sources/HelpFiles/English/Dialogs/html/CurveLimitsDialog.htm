<h2>Curve limits</h2>
<p>You must specify the limits into which the curve will be recognized.</p>
<p>You can enter this value either &quot;by-hand&quot; or by clicking on the &quot;Pick 
  position&quot; button then on the desired location on the graphic. The related 
  field will be filled with the abscissa value corresponding to this point.</p>
<p>In the case of a direct axis (right scale point greater than left one), the 
  right limit value must be greater than the left one. In the case of a reversed 
  axis (left scale point value greater than right one), left limit must be greater 
  than the right one.</p>
<p>If you currently modify an already constructed curve, changing the limits have 
  the following consequences :</p>
<ul>
  <li>All <a href="/Dialogs/html/HandModificationDialog.htm">hand-modifications</a> 
    are lost.</li>
  <li>If an <a href="/Dialogs/html/CurveIdentificationDialog.htm">initial point</a> 
    is outside the new limits, it will be removed (all the curve is able to disappear). 
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
