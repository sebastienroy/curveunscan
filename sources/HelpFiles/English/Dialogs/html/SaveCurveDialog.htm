<h2>Data export</h2>
<p>This window contains two lists in which are displayed respectively the names 
  of the identified curves and the names of the curves which will be saved.</p>
<p>In order to save a curve, you must only selected it and move it from the left 
  list to the right one, using the &quot;==&gt;&quot; button or by double-click 
  on it.</p>
<p>If this curve is a continuous curve, a spline curve or a densitometry curve, 
  a dialog box appears, allowing to specify the number of points to be saved. 
  These values can be modified at any moment by double-click on the curves located 
  in the right list. </p>
<p>You can change the order in which the curves are saved, using the two buttons 
  located to the right of the window.</p>
<p>By pressing the 'Preview' button, a window will appear, showing the data as 
  they will be saved. The preview is however limited to the first 100 lines.</p>
<p>The <a href="/Dialogs/html/ExportFormatDialog.htm">&quot;Format&quot; button</a> 
  is used to change the character used as a column separator. The default column 
  separator can also be chosen via the <a href="/Dialogs/html/ExportSettingDialog.htm">Options 
  / Export panel.</a></p>
