<h2>Y axis identification</h2>
<p>With this dialog box, you can identify the Y axis of your coordinates system. 
  The box contains two main parts : the one used for the axis identification and 
  the part for the scale identification.</p>
<h3>Axis identification</h3>
<p>Initially, when the axis is not still defined, only the part related to its 
  identification is active. You have to draw a line on the graphic, where is located 
  the Y axis. The precision of the results is greatly dependent on the axis draw 
  precision. That's why a particular care must be taken on it. During the draw, 
  the graphic scrolls automatically when the cursor reaches the border of the 
  window. When the shift key is pressed, the line is drawn parallel to the side 
  of the window.</p>
<p>The field &quot;Axis name&quot; is used in order to personalize the axis. For 
  instance, you can enter the unit of the axis.</p>
<h3>Scale definition</h3>
<p>Once the axis is drawn, the elements of the dialog box related to the identification 
  of the first scale point are set active. You have now to click on the graphic, 
  at the location of this scale point. The point actually used for the scale is 
  the nearest point on the axis : it is not necessary to click exactly on the 
  axis. Once the point location is defined, enter its value in the related field. 
  The format of this number is the standard scientific format : values as &quot;123&quot;, 
  &quot;-123&quot;, &quot;123.45&quot;, &quot;123.45e67&quot;, &quot;-123.45e-67&quot; 
  ...&nbsp;are accepted. The value is dynamically displayed on the graphic. </p>
<p>Proceed the same for the second scale point.</p>
<p>The relative position of the two points has no importance. You can either define 
  the second point to the bottom of the first one or to its top. Furthermore, 
  the axis can be reversed : the bottom value can be greater than the top one. 
  To get a better precision,you should define the two points as far as possible 
  one from the other.</p>
<p>The scale can be either linear or logarithmic. In the case of a logarithmic 
  scale, only strictly positive values are accepted.</p>
<p>The &quot;Next&quot; button of the dialog box is set active when all the elements 
  necessary to the axis identification are defined : axis position, scale points 
  and related values.</p>
