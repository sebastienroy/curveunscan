<h2>First point and saving frequency for densitometry curves</h2>
<p>The points of the densitometry curve that will be saved can be defined trough 
  this dialog box.</p>
<h3>Display kind</h3>
<p>In the output file, either the X value of the calculated points, or Y value, 
  or both, can be written. When the analyzed segment is parallel to the abscissa 
  axis, only abscissa value can be displayed. The same when the segment is parallel 
  to the ordinates axis (the other coordinate is constant).</p>
<h3>First saved point</h3>
<p>Initially, the first saved point is the one of the segment which has the lowest 
  abscissa value.</p>
<p>This point must belong to the drawn segment. Its minimum and maximum coordinates 
  values are displayed in the dialog box.</p>
<p>The X and Y are linked one to the other because this point must be on the segment 
  : modifying the abscissa value leads to modify the ordinate value too, and conversely.</p>
<h3>Frequency - Period</h3>
<p>You can express the frequency of saving either through the abscissa frequency 
  or ordinates frequency. A negative value is allowed.</p>
<p>As for the first saved point, the abscissa and the ordinates frequency are 
  linked together. Modifying the X values leads to modify the Y one.</p>
<p>When a scale is logarithmic, the period related to this axis is expressed in 
  decade of unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total number of points which will be saved in the output file is displayed 
  at the bottom of the dialog box.</p>
