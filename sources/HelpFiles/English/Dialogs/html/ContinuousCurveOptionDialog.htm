<h3>Threshold color</h3>
<p>The threshold color is the color used to differentiate the points belonging 
  to the curve from the points belonging to the background of the graphic. If 
  one of the components (red, green or blue) of a pixel is brighter than the threshold 
  color one, the pixel is considered as belonging to the background.</p>
<p>Each component of the threshold color can be adjusted using either a slider 
  or directly in the related edit field. The value must be between 0 (darker) 
  and 255 (brighter). </p>
<p>The threshold color can also be chosen from the graphic, using the &quot;Pick 
  from bitmap&quot; button.</p>
<h3>Curve thickness compensation</h3>
<p>The line thickness of the curve can be compensated through two different algorithms 
  : the &quot;basic&quot; and the &quot;smart&quot; one.</p>
<p>The basic algorithm moves the points of the curve by a fixed value from top 
  to bottom or from bottom to top, depending on the followed side. The value is 
  the half of the curve thickness. The apparent compensation is different on the 
  flat parts of the curve than on the sharp parts.</p>
<p>The &quot;smart&quot; algorithm adjusts the compensation value depending on 
  the curve rate. This can lead to a good compensation at the same time on the 
  flat parts and on the sharp parts of the curve. The number of points used to 
  calculate the rate of the curve can be adjusted from 1 to 32. Attention, high 
  values can lead to a bad compensation on complex curves, due to the &quot;inertia&quot; 
  of the calculus.</p>
