<h2>Manual modifications</h2>
<p>The previously identified curve may not be perfect, due to some annotations 
  on the graphic for instance. In order to remove these imperfections, you can 
  directly modify the curve on the graphic by drawing on it.</p>
<p>Two different tools are available for the modifications : a pen <img border="0" src="../images/Pen.gif" width="22" height="22"> 
  and a rubber <img border="0" src="../images/Rubber.gif" width="22" height="22">.</p>
<p>When the pen is used, the draw replaces the points which have the same abscissa 
  value.</p>
<p>When the rubber is used, the points which have the same abscissa value than 
  the cursor are erased.</p>
<h3>Undo / Redo</h3>
<p>You can undo or redo every modification operation by using the buttons <img border="0" src="../images/Undo.gif" width="48" height="23"> 
  (undo) and <img border="0" src="../images/Redo.gif" width="48" height="23"> (redo). 
  The number of operation kept in memory is only limited by the total amount of 
  available memory. However, the modification history is lost when this dialog 
  box is closed (by using the &quot;Previous&quot; button for instance).</p>
<h3>Reset</h3>
<p>This button cancels all the modification by rebuilding the curve from the data 
  previously defined. This operation can also be canceled by the &quot;Undo&quot; 
  button </p>
