<h2>Options : Continuous curve </h2>
<p>With this panel, you can change the default values used for the construction 
  of the continuous curves.</p>
<h3>Line thickness compensation algorithm</h3>
<p>Two different algorithms can be used for the line thickness compensation :</p>
<p><b>&quot;basic&quot; algorithm </b>: moves the points of the recognized curve 
  with a fixed value. The apparent compensation is so not the same on sharp parts 
  of the curve than on flat ones.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Smart&quot; algorithm</b> : adjusts the compensation depending on 
  the curve derivative. This results to a better compensation, either on flat 
  parts or on sharp ones. The curve derivative is computed around each point using 
  a range of the neighbor points. The number of points used to compute this derivative 
  can be adjusted from 1 to 32. High values can lead to a bad compensation due 
  to the &quot;inertia&quot; of the computation, especially with complicated curves.<br>
</p>
<h3>Threshold color</h3>
<p>The threshold color is the color used to differentiate the points belonging 
  to the curve from the points belonging to the background of the graphic. This 
  color is taken into account during the identification of colored and gray scale 
  graphics. This color is defined with each of its components : red, green, blue. 
  Each component has a value comprised between 0 (darkest) and 255 (brightest). 
  A pixel of the graphic is considered as belonging to the curve if each of its 
  component values are lower than the threshold color ones.</p>
<p>A too dark threshold color leads to a bad curve identification if the graphic 
  is weekly contrasted.</p>
<p>A too bright threshold color leads to the confusion between the &quot;background 
  noise&quot; of the graphic and the curve.</p>
<p>In order to change the threshold color, click on the colored button.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Followed side </h3>
<p>The curve identification is made by following the line, either the top side 
  of the curve or the bottom side. If the curve contains sharp positive peaks, 
  following the top leads to better results (contrarily, if the curve contains 
  negative peaks, following the bottom is better). </p>
<h3>Dashed curve</h3>
<p>By specifying that the curve is dashed, its following is not stopped after 
  each dash but is continued to the next dashes. The <b>maximal distance</b> between 
  dashes can also be changed.</p>
<h3>Default values</h3>
<p>When this button is clicked, all the preview values are set to their defaults.</p>
