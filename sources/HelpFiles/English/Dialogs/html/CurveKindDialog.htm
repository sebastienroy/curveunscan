<h2>Kind of curve</h2>
<p>You have now to decide what kind of graph you want to recognize : a continuous 
  or a discrete graph. This two kind of graph are handled differently.</p>
<h3>Continuous curve</h3>

<p>A continuous curve is composed with one or more parts, of juxtaposed points 
  which can be recognized automatically by CurveUnscan from one or more initial 
  points.</p>
<h3>Discrete curve (scattered points) </h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/Discrete.gif" width="101" height="59"></p>
<p>A discrete curve is composed with scattered points. Each of them have to be 
  identified by the user (a click on them).</p>
