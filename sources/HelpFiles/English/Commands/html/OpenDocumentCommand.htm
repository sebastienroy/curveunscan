<h2>Open document</h2>
<p>By this command you can open a CurveUnscan document. It is available by the 
  File / Open document menu.</p>
<p>The CurveUnscan documents contain a graphic an all the elements necessary for 
  the curve identification : axes, initial points, curve names ...</p>
<p>The file generated by this command cannot be processed by other software, contrary 
  to the file generated by the command &quot;<a href="/Commands/html/SaveCurvesCommand.htm">Data 
  export</a>&quot;. However, by saving the document, you can open it later, for 
  further curve recognition on the same graphic for instance. It is not necessary 
  to perform the recognition from the beginning.</p>
