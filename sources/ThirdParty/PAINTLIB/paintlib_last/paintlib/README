These are temporary release notes for post-2.2 cvs builds. Most of the 
documentation in the 2.2 release still applies. Changes are documented 
here.


Windows install instructions:

- You need to copy config.vc to config.h before you can compile the 
program.
- You need to copy pixeldefs.vc to pixeldefs.h before you can compile the 
program.


Unix/Linux instructions:

- If you want to configure TIFF, PNG or JPEG support you have to:

  Just install in your system the libs. On GNU/Linux it usually are 
  intalled on /usr (lib and include). The configure script just 
  detects the libraries and compile the decoders onto the paintlib
  library. At this moment there is no check of the correct version of 
  the libraries so you have to be sure of the versions.

	 libtiff (http://www.libtiff.org/tiff-v3.5.4.zip)
	 
	 libjpeg (ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz)

	 libpng  (ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/src/lpng103.zip)

	 libz (ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/src/zlib113.zip)

- If there is no system installed libraries the configure script disable this 
  support.

  You can verify the result of executing the configure script just looking at
  paintlib/common/config.h.

- The steps for do that are:

    $ cd paintlib
    
    ¡¡ if you change some Makefile.am or configure.in or acheader.h
    to recreate the configure script !!:

    $ ./reconfig 

       
    If you only want to compile the package:

    $ ./configure 
    $ make

- To install the package:

    $ make install
   
    The default prefix directory to install is /usr/local. So the libraries
    (shared and static versions) are installed on $(prefix)/lib and the 
    header files are installed on $(prefix)/include/paintlib.

    Optionally you can change the prefix directory to install the package
    just like this:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr (for example).

    If you have compiled your own copies of libtiff, libjpeg or libpng and
    libz, you have to install it manually. Just go to the apropiate directories
    and follow the instructions.

- There is some test programs in paintlib/gnu/im2*

- To link against paintlib libraries you have to use the script paintlib-config:

  CFLAGS='paintlib-config --cflags'
  LDFLAGS='paintlib-config --libs'
