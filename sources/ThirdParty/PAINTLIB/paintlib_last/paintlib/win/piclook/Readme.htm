face="Lucida Console">PicLook V2.2</font></h1>

<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console">I originally hacked
this program from the 'DIBLOOK' MFC example, with the added
capability of multi-format viewing besides BMP. This is a testbed
for </font><a href="http://www.paintlib.de"><font
face="Lucida Console">paintlib</font></a><font
face="Lucida Console"> under Win32, really. There's a wealth of
nicer, more capable and free graphics viewers (and even editors)
out there. But the difference is that with this one you get full
source code, which you may reuse at will in derived work. Just
acknowledge their due credit to the authors of paintlib and the
decoding libraries it relies on. </font></p>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">Besides these fine people (please
have a look at the program's &quot;about box&quot;), I also
incorporated in this release some code from other authors. In
particular: </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3><font color="#004080" face="Lucida Console">DrawDib
        drawing:</font></h3>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">The CWinBmpEx illustrates how to
use the DrawDib API as an alternative to plain GDI rendering. It
is greatly inspired by the enjoyable articles of Paul Di Lascia
on the subject, originally published between the january and june
´97 issues of MSJ. They are also now available </font><a
href="http://www.dilascia.com/links"><font face="Lucida Console">online</font></a><font
face="Lucida Console">. Look for &quot;More Fun with MFC: A Gamut
of Reusable Goodies&quot;. While you're at it, read all this
folk's articles. You won't lose your time. &quot;Meandering
Through the Maze of MFC Message and Command Routing&quot; is
particularly enlightening. If you're struggling with MFC on a
regular basis, that is. </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3><font color="#004080" face="Lucida Console">Zooming: </font></h3>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">Brad Pirtle wrote a very good
explanation on how to implement </font><a
href="http://www.codeguru.com/doc_view/zoom_scale.shtml"><font
face="Lucida Console">zooming</font></a><font
face="Lucida Console"> by using the standard GDI devices such as
window and viewport. His code constitutes the ZoomView module I
used in this release of PicLook. </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><h3><font color="#004080" face="Lucida Console">Panning: </font></h3>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">If you have a three-mouse button,
do yourself a favor: go grab the </font><a
href="http://www.codeguru.com/doc_view/autopan2.shtml"><font
face="Lucida Console">panning</font></a><font
face="Lucida Console"> code available at codeguru. It is cleverly
packaged as a DLL, so you don't have to cut and paste code and
resources (cursors mostly) to integrate it in your project. To
activate it within PicLook, define the &quot;OWND&quot; symbol.
Many thanks to Russ Freeman.</font></p>

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th><font color="#800080">Mouse Usage</font></th>
        <th>Default</th>
        <th>Zoom Mode</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Left button</th>
        <td align="center">grab &amp; pan</td>
        <td align="center">zoom in / define area to zoom</td>

    <tr>
        <th>Middle button</th>
        <td align="center">IE-like panning (when ownd.dll is
        available)</td>
        <td align="center">fit to window</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Right button</th>
        <td align="center">&quot;unzoom&quot;</td>
        <td align="center">zoom out</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center></div>

<p><font face="Lucida Console"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">Since the &quot;video for
windows&quot; DrawDib API does not honor the GDI mapping mode
that make zooming possible, this version of the program only uses
it for file previewing. If you feel this makes it slower on your
machine, you can try and recompile with the
&quot;USES_DRAWDIB&quot; symbol defined in the project settings.
But then zooming will not be available...</font></p>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">I hope you'll enjoy PicLook. If
you enrich it somehow, please consider contributing your
enhancements back to PainLib.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Lucida Console">Happy C++ coding,</font></p>
