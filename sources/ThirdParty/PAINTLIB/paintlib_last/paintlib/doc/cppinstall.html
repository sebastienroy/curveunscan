      <P> If you don't have the archive yet, download it. Besides paintlib, you 
        need to download libungif, libpng, zlib, libtiff and libjpeg and unpack 
        them to otherlib/. The download addresses for these packages are given 
        under links in contents. These libraries are maintained by others. (If 
        you don't need support for one of these file formats, you can compile 
        paintlib without these libraries. See "Omitting file formats" below for 
        details.) 
      <P> Some of the archives default to copying files into directories with 
        version-specific names. For instance, the content of tiff-vx.y/ needs 
        to be placed under otherlib/libtiff/. The easiest way to do this is to 
        unpack the archive to otherlib and then rename tiff-vx.y/ to libtiff/. 
        libungif, libjpeg, libpng and zlib need similar treatment. (A note to 
        WinZip users with Netscape: WinZip chokes on the libtiff archive if the 
        extension is -tar.gz. Rename it to .tar.gz.) 
      <P> After the download, you'll need to come back to this page - or to the 
        copy of this page in the documentation included with the archive - to 
        read the instructions on how to get paintlib through the compiler. Trial-and-error 
        is a lot more work than reading the relevant sections of the instructions. 
        Trust me. 
      <P><B>Directory Structure</B> 
      <P> After you've unpacked the paintlib archive, you should have created 
        the following directory structure: 
      <PRE>
      paintlib
        |--bin
        |--doc
        |--lib
        |--obj
        |--otherlib
        |   |--libungif
        |   |--libjpeg
        |   |--libpng
        |   |--libtiff
        |    --zlib
        |--paintX
        |--paintlib
        |   |--common
        |   |   |--Filter
        |   |    --test
        |   |--gnu
        |   |   |--im2bmp
        |   |   |--im2jpeg
        |   |   |--im2png
        |   |   |--im2tiff
        |   |   |--libtiff
        |    --win
        |       |--libjpeg
        |       |--libpng
        |       |--libtiff
        |       |--libungif
        |       |--paintlib
        |       |--paintX
        |       |--piclook
        |       |--test
        |       |--testdec
        |       |--testdib
        |       |--tiffex
        |       |--VBPaintX
        |        --VCPaintX
         --testpic</PRE>
      <P> All platform-independent source code is in src/common/. The src/gnu/ 
        and src/win/-directory trees contain system-specific makefiles and test 
        programs. Every source directory contains a cvs/ subdirectory that's used 
        to store information for the version control system. testpic/ contains 
        a suite of test images in various formats. These pictures are in a separate 
        archive. You don't need to download them to use the library. doc/ contains 
        the paintlib documentation in html format (You're reading it now), and 
        paintX contains the precompiled paintlib ActiveX control (Also in a separate 
        archive). 
      <P><B>Compiling with Visual C++</B> 
      <P> The windows makefiles and projects were created with Microsoft Visual 
        C++ ver. 6.0. There are five libraries (paintlib, libpng, libtiff, libjpeg, 
        libungif) and seven test and example programs to be made. Loading the 
        workspace (src\win\paintlib\paintlib.dsw) into DevStudio and doing a batch 
        build of everything should work. Most of the libraries generate warnings 
        during the build (Ignore them). libpng, libtiff and libjpeg also generate 
        warnings whenever MSVC scans for dependencies. (The dependency scan pays 
        no attention to #ifdefs. Go figure.) 
      <P> Run the test programs. test runs basic automated tests with bitmaps, 
        de- and encoder pairs and filters. Testdec takes a directory as it's command 
        line argument and displays all picture files found. It writes a log to 
        paintlib.log describing success or failure of decoding each file. Testdib 
        demonstrates windows-specific bitmap functions by doing fast blts with 
        transparency. (Two caveats: 1- Both programs don't display very well on 
        256-color systems, since palette considerations are not taken into account. 
        2 - testdib needs a processor with MMX support.) 
      <P> Bernard Delm&eacute;e's PicLook is a complete picture viewer based on 
        paintlib. It implements file loading and saving through paintlib and allows 
        you to try the filters. It also supports printing and print preview, uses 
        palettes, and it shows you a preview in the file open dialog - stuff that 
        many people using paintlib will need. 
      <P> <B>Building with configure</B> 
      <p>If you have a *nix system, try 
      <pre>  ./configure
  make
  make install
  common/test/testpaintlib
</pre>
      <p>in the main directory. The configure script checks for the presence of 
        the libraries that paintlib uses and builds makefiles that fit. (The otherlib/ 
        directory is unused if configure is used). The configure script dosn't 
        check the library versions, so this could be a potential cause of problems. 
        The default prefix directory into which paintlib gets installed is /usr/local. 
        This can be changed by calling configure like this (for example): 
      <pre>  ./configure --prefix=/usr
</pre>
      <p>Libraries are copied to $(prefix)/lib, header files are copied to $(prefix)/include/paintlib.</p>
      <p>There are some test programs in paintlib/gnu/im2*. The main test program 
        is paintlib/common/test/testpaintlib. Debug traces and asserts can be turned 
        on by calling make -CPPFLAGS=D_DEBUG or defining the environment variable 
        CPPFLAGS accordingly before calling make (e.g. export CPPFLAGS=D_DEBUG in bash).<br>
      </p>
      <p><B>Compiling for Other Systems</B> 
      <P> On systems other than the ones mentioned above, you're on your own getting 
        the library through the compiler. I believe someone once got it to work 
        on the Mac, but I've lost contact and don't really know how he did it 
        :-(. The code isn't dependent on any system-specific functions, and it 
        should work for both little- and big-endian systems. It does need a relatively 
        new C++-compiler which supports exceptions. 
      <P> It shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows his operating system 
        to get paintlib to work. If you succeed, I'd love to know. 
      <P><B>Omitting File Formats</B> 
      <P> If you only need a subset of the supported file formats, you can compile 
        paintlib to include only those formats you need. The file config.h defines 
        a symbol for every file format. To remove file format support from paintlib, 
        remove the corresponding defines from config.h and the corresponding source 
        file from the project-/configure-/makefile. If you remove support for 
        PNG, you don't need libpng or zlib anymore. If you remove support for 
        TIFF or JPEG, you don't need libtiff or libjpeg anymore (duh). Removing 
        JPEG support also removes support for JPEG-encoded TIFF and PICT files. 
        Because of this, removing JPEG support without removing TIFF support means 
        that libtiff needs to be reconfigured.
