Before the legalese starts, here's the translation to plain
english:

<OL>
<LI>Do whatever you want with paintlib. Just don't come running to me
    with a lawyer if something goes wrong.
<LI>If you redistribute paintlib, you should redistribute the whole library
    including documentation and copyright. If that is not possible, you
    must make it clear that you're distributing a changed version. In no
    event may any part of the library be distributed without this
    copyright notice.
<LI>If you use paintlib in your program, you must acknowledge this,
    preferably in the about box and the documentation.
</OL>

<P>
The legalese itself is a derivative work. I modified the LIBPNG copyright
notice. Thanks, guys :-).

      <P> The paintlib source code and all documentation are copyright (c) 1996-2002 
        Ulrich von Zadow and other contributors.

        special, exemplary, or consequential damages, which may result from the

        <LI>Executables containing paintlib or parts of it must state that the

          in at least one place where the copyright for the software itself is 
          displayed. The documentation must also contain this notice. 
      </OL>

      <P> Note that libpng, zlib, libtiff and the jpeg library have their own 
        terms of use. You can find these in the documentation of the libraries.
