      <P><B>Bitmap Operations</B> 
      <P> paintlib works on bitmaps. The abstract class PLBmp defines an interface 
        for bitmap storage and manipulation. The actual details of storage are 
        defined in derived classes. The contents of a bitmap can be changed either 
        via Filter objects or by directly accessing the bits. Among others, filters 
        for resizing, cropping, rotating and blurring an image are included. PLBmp 
        implements color depth conversion from and to 1,8,24 and 32 bpp. The standard 
        equality and assignment operators are implemented as well and convert 
        between the derived classes transparently. paintlib provides basic classes 
        for pixels, points and rectangles.
      <P>Currently, four classes derived from PLBmp are defined: PLWinBmp for 
        windows DIBs (Device Independent Bitmaps), PLAnyBmp for simple OS-independent 
        storage, PLDIBSection for windows DIB sections and the experimental PLDDrawBmp 
        class that stores images in DirectDraw system memory surfaces. New classes 
        can be defined for other operating systems and storage formats, the only 
        restriction being that pixels in one line are stored consecutively and 
        not as separate planes. To be compatible with the decoders, a bitmap class 
        must define formats with 1, 8 and 32 bpp. Bitmaps with alpha channels 
        are supported. 
      <P> [Bernard Delmées piclook (one of the sample programs) contains PLDrawDibBmp, 
        a derived bitmap class that uses the windows DrawDIB api for blitting.] 
      <P> There is virtually no difference in speed between using the OS-independent 
        interface and directly accessing OS-dependent data. The power of this 
        design is demonstrated by the testdib demo. This demo includes classes 
        which implement complex bitblts with alpha information, resizing, and 
        transparency in an OS-independent fashion. The classes are documented 
        in the read.me file in the testdib directory. 
      <P><b>Filters</b>
      <P>Filters encapsulate operations on bitmaps. To the user of the library, 
        a filter is similar to a function that can be called for a bitmap. However, 
        filters are independent of the actual bitmap class: Each filter works 
        with every bitmap class. In addition, putting filters in separate classes 
        allows you to use filters as part of a command pattern: you can put filters 
        in a queue and parameterize algorithms with different filters, among others. 
        Here is a list of some of the filters currently included with paintlib: 
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast</li>
        <li>Crop</li>
        <li>Extract alpha channel</li>
        <li>Convert to grayscale</li>
        <li>Intensity</li>
        <li>Lightness</li>
        <li>Color quantization (conversion of true-color images to 256 colors)</li>
        <li>Bilinear resize</li>
        <li>Gaussian blur</li>
        <li>Threshold</li>
      </ul>
      <p><B>Image File Decoding</B> </p>
      <P> paintlib can decode image files and store the data in an object of any 
        of the PLBmp-derived classes. Supported file formats are GIF, PGM, PPM, 
        PNG, TGA, TIFF, JPEG, PCX, Photoshop PSD, Windows BMP, and Mac PICT as 
        well as TIFF previews in EPS files. Support for PNG is through the PNG 
        reference library libpng. TIFF is supported through use of Sam Leffler's 
        libtiff. This library is the most complete implementation of the TIFF 
        standard that I know of. The Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg provides 
        solid support for the JPEG/JFIF format. The GIF decoder uses libungif 
        (maintained by Eric Raymond). The Photoshop decoder allows access to the 
        individual layers saved in the file as separate bitmaps..
      <P>Be aware that using a gif decoder in your program can might cause legal 
        problems - see the libungif documentation for details. If you'd like to 
        use paintlib without gif support, you can compile it without this support. 
        In fact, you can exclude support for any file types you don't need. 
      <P> The library is capable of auto-detection of the image file type. Input 
        data can come from memory or disk - or from a custom data source. Under 
        windows, images linked into the .exe as resources can also be loaded. 
        All data is converted to 32 bpp before being handed to the application. 
        1 bpp tiffs are an exception to this rule - they get handed to the application 
        as 1 bpp. 
      <P><B>Image File Encoding</B> 
      <P> The encoding classes store images. Currently implemented are BMP, TIFF 
        (via libtiff), JPEG (via libjpeg) and PNG (via libpng). Data storage is 
        handled by data sink classes. A data sink for disk files is provided; 
        others can be implemented. 
      <P><B>Open Design</B> 
      <P> One of the primary design goals for paintlib was openness for expansion. 
        Implementing additional en- and decoders is simple because many basic 
        operations (data source management, MSB/LSB conversion, error handling,...) 
        have been taken care of already. Integrating libpng, for example, took 
        Gilles and me about two days (total) of work. The data sources and sinks 
        and the bitmap format can be tailored to suit the needs of the users. 
        The filter interface is very thin, so creating new filters is easy. 
      <P> While most of the development is being done under Microsoft Visual C++, 
        paintlib is plattform-independent and *nix configure files are available. 
        This plattform independence causes no performance degradation that we 
        know of.
