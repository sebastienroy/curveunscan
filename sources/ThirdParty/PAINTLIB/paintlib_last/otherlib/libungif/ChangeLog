          Reflect Eric's copyright notice rather than Gershon's

1999 14 Jan  Michael R Brown <michael@arrakeen.demon.co.uk>
        * lib/gif_lib.h: Add OutputFunc type
        * lib/gif_lib.h: Add EGifOpen for user supplied output function
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (EGifOpenFileName) Fixed wasted memory when an
          error occurs in EGifOpenFileHandle
        * lib/egif_lib.c: Add EGifOpen, WRITE, and lots of changes to
          support user supplied output function. Basically changing
          all fwrite's to WRITE, and then all of the knock on effects.

1998 15 Dec Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifSlurp) Fix a Seg Fault when an image contains
          no extension blocks.

1998 14 Dec Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * configure.in: Update version to 4.0
        * lib/Makefile.am: Update libtool version to 4:0:0 (libtool)
        * libungif.spec: Update for version 4.0 (not binary compatible with
          giflib, change version.)
        * lib/gif_lib_private.h: (PrivateType) New header for common stuff
          private to the library.  Currently, this is only the Private struct.
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (PrivateType) Extract the Private struct to
          gif_lib_private.h
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (PrivateType) Extract the Private struct to
          gif_lib_private.h
        * lib/Makefile.am: Add gif_lib_private.h to the list of source files.
        * lib/gif_lib.h: (ExtensionBlock) Add a Function entry to the
          ExtensionBlock record.  Note that this is not entirely correct:
          the GifLib ExtensionBlock structure is actually a data sub-block
          record.  By adding the function entry here, we are pushing the
          ExtensionBlockType in with the DataSubBlock.
          Sometime in the future, we need to change the API to have true
          ExtensionBlocks which have DataSubBlocks belonging to them.
        * lib/gif_lib.h: (ExtensionBlock) Deprecate the use of Function in
          the SavedImage struct.  Use ExtensionBlock's Function instead.
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (EGifSpew) Changes to use the new Function variable.
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifSlurp) Changes to put data into the new
          Function variable.

1998 3 Dec  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifSlurp) Three changes:
          - No longer allocate SaveImage in this function.  All allocations
            of SaveImage take place in DGifGetImageDesc.
          - Extension blocks are now associated with the Image Block that is
            read in subsequent to them, not before.  This should now be
            conformant to the gif89a specification.
          - Fix an off-by-one error when copying extension data from structure
            to structure.
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifGetImageDesc) Change the function to do its own
          allocation of space for the SavedImage structure no matter what.
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (EGifSpew) The function now spits out
          ExtensionBlocks before the associated Image Block to conform with
          the gif89a specification.
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (EGifOpenFileHandle) Move the write of the
          GifVersion (gif87a or gif89a) from this function into
          EGifPutScreenDesc so that it can be controlled by EGifSpew.  Note
          that this is still a hack as the GifVersion write doesn't really
          belong in either of these functions.
        * lib/egif_lib.c: (EGifPutScreenDesc) Moved writing the version
          (gif87a or gif89a) into the file into this function from
          EGifOpenFileHandle.
        * test-unx: Now test the extension code.
        * pic/x-trans.gif: New image with Comments and transparency to test
          the extension code with.

1998 29 Nov Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifSlurp) Fix a few of the minor bugs plaguing
          this function.  At this point, the function should no longer cause
          a Seg Fault.  It is now losing all extension data however.  I know
          how to hack a fix in, but I need to commit these changes first.
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifGetImageDesc) Fix my bug fix: the colormap is
          now only copied if it exists :-).

1998 10 Nov Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * test-unx: Add a test for DGifSlurp and EGifSpew

1998 14 Oct Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifGetImageDesc) Fix a bug where the Colormap for
          the image description and the SaveImage were pointers to the same
          structure, causing a SegV when DGifClosing the file.

1998 9 Oct  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c: (DGifSlurp) memory for the extensions was not being
          allocated.  Now I call AddExtensionBlock when I add an extension to
          the structure.  Additionally, fix a memory leak here.
        * configure.in, NEWS, lib/Makefile.am: Update to version 3.1.1
        * ltmain.sh, ltconfig: removed from the cvs repository
        * BUGS: add the BUGS file to list unresolved BUGS.

1998 9 Sep  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * libungif.spec: Fix wrong version in %files and %install section.

1998 8 Sep  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/gif_hash.c, lib/gif_hash.h: Removed these because a hash table
          is not needed to create uncompressed gifs.
        * lib/egif_lib.c: Remove all references to the hash functions.
        * lib/Makefile.am: Remove gif_hash.c gif_hash.h from the source files.
        * libungif.lsm: added this file
 
1998 7 Sep  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * lib/dgif_lib.c, lib/gif_lib.h: (DGifOpen) Add callback to read gif
          image through user supplied function (Peter Mehlitz).

1998 6 Sep  Toshio Kuratomi <badger@prtr-13.ucsc.edu>
        * util/*.{gif.rle}: removed files that were left by my testing
          process and shouldn't have been in the distribution.
        * UNCOMPRESSED_GIF: add section on why software that can decode
          LZW compressed gifs (but not write them) is legal.
        * .cvsignore: added .cvsignore files to ignore Makefiles and other
          generated files in my cvs repository.
        * Makefile.am's: Fixes to allow the dist* family of targets to work
          correctly.  Preliminary support for make check as well.
        * configure.in: Update version to 3.1.0
        * lib/Makefile.am: Update libtool version to 4:0:1 libtool)
        * libungif-3.0.spec: Update from Marc Ewing.
        * Add int/pointer Alpha fixes from Dick Porter to many source files.
