<h2>Curve identification</h2>

<h3>Initial points</h3>
<p>In order to identify the curve, CurveUnscan needs to know its location on the 
  graphic. When this dialog box is displayed, the &quot;Pick curve&quot; button 
  is pressed and the dialog box is waiting you to click on the curve.</p>
<p>As the curve may be composed of several parts, you have to click on each of 
  them.</p>
<p>For instance, for the following graphic, if you want to identify the curve 
  A, you can do the following steps :</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the segment 1 of the curve A : if the followed side is the top 
    one (see later), CurveUnscan will follow the segment 1 of the curve A, the 
    segment 2 of the curve B and the segment 3 of the curve A.</li>
  <li>Click on the segment 2 of the curve A : the segments 1, 2 and 3 of the curve 
    are identified.</li>
  <li>In order to identify the right part of the curve, click on the segments 
    4 and 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>N.B. : you can obtain the same result by clicking on the segments 2 and 5.</p>

<h3>Side to follow</h3>
<p>You can specify which side of the curve CurveUnscan will follow : the top or 
  the bottom. In the case of a curve containing positive peaks, following the 
  top lead to a better result. In the case of negative peaks, following the bottom 
  is better.</p>
<h3>Curve thickness</h3>
<p>The scanned curve having some thickness, the identified curve must be translated 
  in order to take this thickness into account. The thickness value can be defined 
  either manually or by clicking on the &quot;Pick&quot; button then on the curve. 
  The calculated value is the vertical thickness of the curve on this location.</p>
<h3>Dashed curve</h3>
<p>CurveUnscan can identify dashed curves. When this option is activated, the 
  curve following is not stopped at the end of each dash but is propagated to 
  the next dashes. The distance between dashes must be less than the specified 
  value. In order to change this value, click on the &quot;modify&quot; button.</p>
<h3>Curve name</h3>
<p>This name will be used in the output file in order to identify this curve.</p>
<h3>Advanced options</h3>
<p>This button opens a dialog box which allows to modify some advanced parameters 
  : the threshold color for curve identification and the algorithm used for the 
  thickness compensation.</p>
