<h1>1st step : original graphic scanning</h1>
<p>The original graphic can be directly scanned with CurveUnscan (File / Scanner 
  / Import menu), or with any other software. In the last case, you only have 
  to save it into a file than open it with CurveUnscan (File / Open graphic menu). 
  CurveUnscan can open almost every graphic file format (bmp, gif, pict, jpeg, 
  png, tiff, ...).</p>
<h2>Precision linked to resolution</h2>
<p>The final result precision depends on the original graphic document quality 
  and on the scanning resolution.</p>
<p>The result precision is, at best, two times lower than the scanning resolution. 
  It means that if the scale goes from 0 to 100 on a 10 cm graphic, with a 300 
  dpi scanning the resolution is 100 units / 1200 pixels = 0.1 units / pixel. 
  The best precision that we can expect is then 0.2 units.</p>
<p>The result precision is also limited by the original document quality. For 
  most of the graphics found in the literature, the precision gain is weak for 
  scanning resolution up to 300 dpi.</p>
<p>Be careful however with the size of the graphic file when using high resolutions. 
  A too big graphic file (resulting from a too high scanning resolution), can 
  lead to slow down the CurveUnscan data processing.</p>
<h2>Scanning mode : line - gray scale - colors</h2>
<p>If the original curve is a black and white one, use the line mode of the scanner. 
  The luminosity must be adjusted in order to have plain curves (not porous, see 
  figure). </p>
<p>For the gray scale or color graphics, using a high contrast make easier the 
  continuous curve recognition. </p>
