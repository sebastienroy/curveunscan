<h1>Curve recognition algorithms (continuous curves)</h1>
<h3>Curve following</h3>
<p>From an initial point, chosen by the user, the border between the line and 
  the curve background is followed to the left and to the right of the initial 
  point.</p>
<p>According to the user choice, the upper(a) or the lower(b) border is used to 
  follow the curve.</p>

<h3>Threshold color</h3>
<p>In the case of a monochromatic graphic, the black pixels are considered as 
  part of the curve and the white pixels as the background. In the case of gray 
  scale or colored graphics, the difference between curve and background is made 
  as following :</p>
<ul>
  <li>A threshold color is chosen. The default values of its components are 70, 
    on a scale from 0 (black) to 255 (white).</li>
  <li>Every pixel having one of its components (red, green or blue) brighter than 
    the threshold color related one is considered as being part of the background.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stop condition</h3>
<p>The curve is stopped when one of these conditions is satisfied :</p>
<ul>
  <li>The current pixel is outside the curve definition range</li>
  <li>The end of the curve is reached</li>
  <li>The followed curve crosses an other part of the same curve (case of several 
    initial points)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dashed Curves</h3>
<p>CurveUnscan can perform recognition on dashed curves. If the &quot;dashed curve&quot; 
  option is selected, the curve following, instead of stopping at the end of the 
  dash, is extended to the next dashed and also from one to each other. The maximal 
  distance between two dashes is specified by the user.</p>
<h3>Initial point validity</h3>
<p>The initial point is valid if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is part of a line (the value of each of its color components is less 
    than the threshold one)</li>
  <li>Its abscissa value belongs to the curve definition range</li>
  <li>This point doesn't already belong to the followed curve. In the case of 
    several initial points, the curves are build from left to right, following 
    the initial points. If after the reconstruction of the whole curves (for instance 
    in the case of changing the side to follow), an initial point belongs to the 
    already built curve, this initial point is considered as redundant and is 
    deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Curves intersection</h3>
<p>The curve intersections are handled as following (the different parts are generated 
  from left to right) :</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the curves have no points with same abscissa (a), the whole curves are 
    kept.</li>
  <li>The curves are crossed (b). The right curve is stopped when its points belong 
    to the left curve. The points of the left curve located to the right of this 
    intersection are deleted.</li>
  <li>If the curves are overlapping (c and d), the following of the right curve 
    is stopped at the initial point of the left curve. The points of the left 
    curve located to the right of the last point of the right curve are deleted.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Curve thickness compensation</h3>
<p>Once the curve is built from the initial points, it is translated to the bottom 
  or to the top, according to the side chosen to be followed.</p>
<p>Two algorithms are available in order to process this translation</p>
<p>Basic algorithm (b) : the points are translated from a constant value, equal 
  to the half of the curve thickness. The curve thickness is specified by the 
  user.</p>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; algorithm (c) : the translation value depends on the curve 
  thickness and on the rate of the curve. The number of points used to calculate 
  the rate can be modified by the user.</p>
<p>The default algorithm is the &quot;smart&quot; one.</p>

<p>Curve recognition with different parameters for curve thickness compensation. 
  a : without compensation. b : basic algorithm. c: &quot;smart&quot; algorithm.</p>
