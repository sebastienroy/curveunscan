<h2>Coordinates system identification</h2>
<p>The coordinates system is made of two axes, themselves defined with a segment 
  and two scale points. A scale point is defined with a position on the graphic 
  and with an associated value.</p>
<p>The coordinates system identification is made through two dialog boxes, one 
  for each axis.</p>

<p>The behavior of the X and Y axis dialog boxes is identical, only their aspect 
  is slightly different.</p>
<p>A line at the bottom of the dialog box guide the user through the axis identification 
  step. </p>
<p>When the axis is not still defined, the element related to the scale are grayed 
  and the &quot;Draw axis&quot; button is pushed. The dialog box is waiting for 
  the user to draw a line on the related graphic axis in order to identify it. 
  If the Shift key is pressed during the draw, the line is drawn parallel to the 
  side of the window. When the cursor reaches the border of the window, the graphic 
  scrolls automatically.</p>
<p>The &quot;Axis name&quot; field of the dialog box allows to name it. This name 
  will be used in the exported file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the axis location is defined, the elements related to the point 1 of the 
  scale become active, the &quot;Pick position&quot; button is pushed and the 
  cursor is set into the &quot;Value&quot; field.</p>
<p>Click then on the desired location for this point and enter its value. It is 
  not necessary to choose this point exactly on the axis, because the point actually 
  used for the scale definition is the one resulting from the projection of the 
  chosen point on the axis.</p>
<p>Once the point 1 is defined, the elements related to the second point become 
  active too. Proceed then as for the first one.</p>
<p>The scale can be either linear or logarithmic. In the case of a logarithmic 
  scale only strictly positive values are accepted.</p>
<p>You can modify each element of the scale at any moment, by clicking on the 
  related button of the dialog box.</p>
<p>The &quot;Next button&quot; is set active when all the element of the axis 
  are defined : axis location, scale points location and values.</p>
