<h1>Data export</h1>
<p>The data are exported into a text directly readable by MS-Excel or by any other 
  spreadsheet, data processing software, ...</p>
<p>One exported file can contain the data related to one or more curves.</p>
<p><b>Discrete curve</b> : the curve points are written in the order in which 
  they have been defined by the user during the curve construction.</p>
<p><b>Continuous curve</b> : the points are written in the ascending order of 
  their abscissa value. The first point of the curve is specified by the user, 
  in order to get a round-off number.</p>
<p>The period between each point is defined by the user too. If the abscissa axis 
  is logarithmic, this period is express by the mean of unit decade.</p>
<p>The last written point is the last defined one.</p>
<p>If the curve is not defined on some values (or if the first points specified 
  by the user are not defined), the undefined points are expressed only by their 
  abscissa value. The ordinate value is empty.</p>
<p>The ordinate value of each point is the linear interpolation of the physical 
  points of the curve (see figure).</p>

<p><b>Splines curves</b> : The user chooses the number of points to be saved for 
  each segment of the spline curve.</p>
<p ><b>Densitometry curves</b> : The points are saved according to the direction 
  defined by the user : increasing or decreasing abscissa or ordinate value.</p>
<p >As for the continuous curves, the interval between points is defined by the 
  user, and the values of the saved points are calculated through a linear interpolation 
  of the pixel values on the graphic.</p>
<p >&nbsp;</p>
<b>Notice</b> : The data can also be saved into a CurveUnscan specific file format 
(CurveUnscan document). These files contain all the informations related to a 
document and can be used to reuse the same document (without performing all the 
recognition process) to export the data in an other format.
