<h1>Curves</h1>
<p>CurveUnscan handles four kind of curves : discrete curves (scattered points), 
  continuous curves, spline curves and densitometry curves.</p>
<p>Each curve is related to a coordinates system which must have been built previously. 
  Note that an unlimited number of curves can be built on a coordinates system.</p>
<h2>Discrete Curve</h2>
<p>The discrete curves (scattered points) are composed from a set of independent 
  points. These points are individually identified by the user.</p>
<h2>Continuous Curve</h2>
<p>The continuous curves are composed with one or more groups of juxtaposed points. 
  A continuous curve is identified through 3 main steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Identification of the definition range</li>
  <li>Automatic recognition step, from one ore more genesis points</li>
  <li>Manual correction of the imperfections that can subsist.</li>
</ul>
<p>The automatic recognition step identifies the curve from initial points, by 
  following the graphic points. The process can differentiate several crossed 
  curves, can identify dashed curves and takes into account the curve thickness. 
</p>
<p>Though the coordinates system is totally independent from the physical one 
  (pixels), the continuous curves present some constraints with the coordinates 
  system: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The curves are applications from X space to Y space in the physical coordinates 
    system (only one y value is defined for a particular x value)</li>
  <li>During the data export, the curves are considered as application in the 
    logical coordinates system (the one built by the user)</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints have few influence on the curve identification if the coordinates 
  system tilt is less than the largest rate value of the curve. In the case of 
  curves with very sharp peaks, you must take care of the scanning operation in 
  order to have a small graphic tilt.</p>
<h2>Spline curves</h2>
 
<p> The spline curves are built using a mathematic definition, from anchor points 
  which position are defined by the user.</p>
<p>With the spline curves, the user is allowed (if the curve is not too much complicated), 
  to quickly interpolate its graphic curve, with a good precision from a limited 
  number of anchor points. </p>
<p>The spline curves are built as in a drawing tool, by clicking on the graphic 
  in order to set and drag the anchor points.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Densitometry curves</h2>
<p>The densitometry curves are used to identify a color profil on the graphic. 
  The user defines a segment on the graphic and a value is calculated for each 
  pixel of this segment. This value is calculated according to a color scale which 
  is also defined by the user.</p>
